abstract = {Client fingerprinting techniques enhance classical cookie-based user tracking to increase the robustness of tracking techniques. A unique identifier is created based on characteristic attributes of the client device, and then used for deployment of personalized advertisements or similar use cases. Whereas fingerprinting performs well for highly customized devices (especially desktop computers), these methods often lack in precision for highly standardized devices like mobile phones. In this paper, we show that widely used techniques do not perform well for mobile devices yet, but that it is possible to build a fingerprinting system for precise recognition and identification. We evaluate our proposed system in an online study and verify its robustness against misclassification. Fingerprinting of web clients is often seen as an offence to web users' privacy as it usually takes place without the users' knowledge, awareness, and consent. Thus, we also analyze whether it is possible to outrun fingerprinting of mobile devices. We investigate different scenarios in which users are able to circumvent a fingerprinting system and evade our newly created methods.},

abstract = {Information systems might access, manage and record sensitive data about citizens. In addition, the pervasiveness of these systems is dramatically increasing and increasing thanks to the mobile and the IoT revolutions. However, several unintended data breaches are reported every week, and this might compromise the privacy, safety, and security of citizens. For all these reasons, the European Parliament approved in April 2016 the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The main goal of such regulation is to protect the privacy of citizens with regard to the processing of their personal data. It enforces a Privacy by Design and by Default approach, where personal data is processed only when needed by the functionalities of the information system. On the other hand, static analysis aims at proving at compile time various properties on information systems. This discipline has been widely applied during the last decades to identify potential software leaks of sensitive data. In this scenario, this paper discusses what role static analysis could play in a GDPR perspective. In particular, we introduce GDPR and static analysis, and we then propose how existing taint analyses and backward slicing algorithms might be combined to produce reports useful for GDPR compliance. We identify four main actors in the GDPR compliance process (namely, data protection officers, chief information security officers, project managers, and developers), and we propose a specific level of reporting for each of them.},

@article{Iordanou2018,
abstract = {A tracking flow is a flow between an end user and a Web tracking service. We develop an extensive measurement methodology for quantifying at scale the amount of tracking flows that cross data protection borders, be it national or international, such as the EU28 border within which the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) applies. Our methodology uses a browser extension to fully render advertising and tracking code, various lists and heuristics to extract well known trackers, passive DNS replication to get all the IP ranges of trackers, and state-of-the art geolocation. We employ our methodology on a dataset from 350 real users of the browser extension over a period of more than four months, and then generalize our results by analyzing billions of web tracking flows from more than 60 million broadband and mobile users from 4 large European ISPs. We show that the majority of tracking flows cross national borders in Europe but, unlike popular belief, are pretty well confined within the larger GDPR jurisdiction. Simple DNS redirection and PoP mirroring can increase national confinement while sealing almost all tracking flows within Europe. Last, we show that cross boarder tracking is prevalent even in sensitive and hence protected data categories and groups including health, sexual orientation, minors, and others.},
